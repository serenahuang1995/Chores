# Chores
To solve the household of uneven distribution, Chores will help people to handle housework allocation. Let people add and claim housework by themselves, just like accepting game tasks. It also encourages people to do chores actively via a point system. 
Hope to achieve spontaneous sharing of chores and create a clean and comfortable environment together.
